/*
 * Draw a vector in dst from pos0 to pos1.  Hard part
 * here is clipping, which is done against the rectangle
 * of dst quickly and with proper interpolation so that
 * the jaggies in the vectors are independent of clipping.
 *
 * After eliminating the special cases where the vector
 * is horizontal or vertical, there remain to be considered
 * the cases where delta(x) > delta(y) and delta(x) < delta(y),
 * and also the difference in having delta(y) negative or positive.
 * We remember the four cases in the variable b, encoded as follows:
 *
 *		 minor	     major
 *	b	movement    movement
 *
 *	0	   +Y	       +X
 *	1	   +X	       +Y
 *	2	   -Y	       +X
 *	3	   +X	       -Y
 *
 * We define the correct vector to be one where, if delta(x) is
 * greater than delta(y) there are never 2 pixels drawn with the
 * same delta(x).  This is not the complete definition of the
 * vector (which is given below in the context of explaining
 * vector clipping).
