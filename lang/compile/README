REGRESSION TESTING OF COMPILE:
==============================

   <The old contents of this file are now out of date.
    All regression testing is now done under the "test_dir2"
    directory.  Note that cross-compilers, or a faked-out
    version of them, must be installed in order for the
    regression test to work.>
