The intent of this file is to state, and explain if necessary, the
intention of unusual, non obvious, or oddball changes to any UNIX
source that could not be determined from the SCCS history.  This could
include policy issues, like clarifications, statements, or changes;
decoupled corrections, like related changes to the kernel and the stand
alone programs; and hacks to get around transitory problems.  It might
also be useful to indicate which set of things had to be changed for a
temporary hack, so that all the files could be rewacked en masse when
the hack is removed.  Note that the SCCS history is still the primary
information source if the change is completely self contained.

The intended format is:
